## 🌀 **Understanding Bloc Architecture**

Bloc (Business Logic Component) is a powerful state management library that separates business logic from UI, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.

- **Cubit**: Handles simple states for lightweight implementations.
- **Bloc**: Manages more complex state transitions.
- **Events and States**: Clearly defined structures ensure predictable flows and behavior.
